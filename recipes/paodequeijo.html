    <h2>A delicious snack for your family, in a smaller portion for moments where you have visits at home.</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup olive oil or butter</li>
        <li>⅓ cup water</li>
        <li>⅓ cup milk or soy milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups tapioca flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>⅔ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 beaten eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine olive oil, water, milk, and salt in a large saucepan and place over high heat. Bring to a boil and immediately remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in tapioca flour and garlic, stirring until smooth. Set aside to rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir cheese and eggs into tapioca mixture until combined; the dough will be chunky, like cottage cheese.</li>
        <li>Drop dough by 1/4 cup-size balls onto an ungreased baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
